**This is the first blog post, it will serve as a test.**

With my portfolio website I'm learning to use animations to make the page more beautiful, I also gave the website a more futuristic touch, I'm enjoying the result.

On the homepage, the first section will be with the main information about me and along with the links to my social networks, I put a black hole that represents my passion for astronomy 😁.

Below my information I put my work, for now that was all, I intend to add more things to always leave with relevant information.
